#+TITLE: VMTools

A set of tools for managing my VFIO setup. Might proove useful as a sample, but
most likely won't work on most systems without changes.

Manages the intialization of the VM, and attaching/detaching devices (including
a monitor, keyboard, and mouse). It runs as a systemd service and is accessible
through an HTTP interface so that both the host and the guest have access,
making it easy to add keyboard shortcuts to perform various functions.

Make sure to ~git submodule init --update --recursive~ for pyddcci.
